name: Mysterious Fossil
supertype: Trainer
hp: '10'
rules:
- Play Mysterious Fossil as if it were a Basic Pokémon. While in play, Mysterious
  Fossil counts as a Pokémon (instead of a Trainer card). Mysterious Fossil has no
  attacks, can't retreat, and can't be Asleep, Confused, Paralyzed, or Poisoned. If
  Mysterious Fossil is Knocked Out, it doesn't count as a Knocked Out Pokémon. (Discard
  it anyway.) At any time during your turn before your attack, you may discard Mysterious
  Fossil from play.
